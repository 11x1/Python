# Description:
# Take an array containing finished tic-tac-toe game table and check who won
#

# Update (07.12.2021)
# This would not work if one of the elements position isn't in win condition position but that element type still won:
# ex.
#
#    X X O   table (x)  1 1 0
#    X O O      ->      1 0 0
#    X                  1 0 0
#
# X still won but table [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] isn't in win conditions -> use exercise_5_re_p.py
#
